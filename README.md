# FLIM-Builder

Code will be available after publication.

This is the official repository of the software FLIM-Builder. FLIM-Builder provides an interface for training FLIM-based CNNs. In FLIM Builder, the user can define the network architecture, load and annotate the dataset, train the CNN using FLIM, see each kernel's activation (an manually select them if desired), and run on the validation set.
